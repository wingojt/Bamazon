# Bamazon Customer App

A CLI app that uses Node.js and mySQL to display current product inventory and allow for a user to "purchase" items from the available stock.

# Initialize the CLI app by running the following command:

node bamazonCustomer.js

# Step One: Inventory Display

The bamazonCustomer app will automatically display the current available inventory

# Step Two: Purchase Prompt

Once the inventory has been viewed, the user can select an item to purchase.

Users are currently limited to single-item purchases only. 

# Step Three: Confirmation and Total

The bamazonCustomer app then displays the user's choice for them along with the total of their purchase.

# Future Improvements

Allow users to increase quantity of items purchased beyond 1.

Allow users to confirm their purchase. 

Allow for users to be redirected to the inventory view if they attempt to order a product that is not currently available (out of stock).
